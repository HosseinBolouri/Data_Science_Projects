# Data Science, Machine Learning & Data Analysis Projects

Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis portfolio showcasing SQL, Python (Pandas, SciPy, stats, numpy, matplotlib, TensorFlow), Machine Learning (ML) and Data Analysis projects from DataCamp, Coursera, and independent data science work.

## Projects
### 1. Univariate Linear Regression: City Profit Prediction (Supervised Learning)
- Implements linear regression from scratch (manual cost and gradient) to predict company profit based on city population (dataset: ex1data1.txt).
- Uses gradient descent (alpha=0.01, iterations=1500), plots training data and fitted line, and predicts profit for populations of 35,000 and 70,000.

### 2. Logistic Regression: Exam Admission Classification (Supervised Learning)
- Classifies student admission (0/1) from two exam scores using logistic regression from scratch (sigmoid, unregularized cost & gradient, gradient descent, decision boundary, accuracy).
- Notebook: [Logistcs_Regression_Students.ipynb](Logistcs_Regression_Students.ipynb)

### 3. Regularized Logistic Regression: Microchip Quality Classification
- Predicts accepted vs rejected microchips using two test scores with polynomial feature mapping (degree 6) and L2 regularization.
- Implements feature mapping, regularized cost/gradient, gradient descent, non-linear decision boundary, and training accuracy (dataset: ex1data3.txt).
- Notebook: [Logistic_Regression_Microchips.ipynb](Logistic_Regression_Microchips.ipynb)

### 4. Investigating Netflix Data for 90s
- Exploratory data analysis of Netflix movies from the 1990s.
- Notebook: [Investigating_Netflix_Original.ipynb](Investigating_Netflix_Original.ipynb)

### 5. International Students Mental Health Analysis (SQL Project)
- PostgreSQL analysis on impact of stay duration on mental health.
- Notebook: [Project_SQL_Original_Students_Mental_Health.ipynb](Project_SQL_Original_Students_Mental_Health.ipynb)

### 6. NYC Public School SAT Performance Analysis
- Pandas analysis to identify top math schools, overall best schools, borough variability.
- Notebook: [NYC_Project_DataCamp.ipynb](NYC_Project_DataCamp.ipynb)

### 7. Two-Way ANOVA: Braking Performance Analysis
- Two-way ANOVA using SciPy and Pandas.
- Notebook: [ANOVA 2 ways- braking example.ipynb](ANOVA%202%20ways-%20braking%20example.ipynb)
