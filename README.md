- Notebook: [univariate-linear-regression-city-profit.ipynb](https://github.com/HosseinBolouri/data-science-ml-projects/blob/main/univariate-linear-regression-city-profit.ipynb)

### 3. Logistic Regression: Exam Admission Classification (Supervised Learning)
- From-scratch logistic regression (sigmoid, cost, gradient, decision boundary).
- Notebook: [Logistcs_Regression_Students.ipynb](Logistcs_Regression_Students.ipynb)

### 4. Regularized Logistic Regression: Microchip Quality Classification
- Polynomial feature mapping (degree 6) + L2 regularization, custom cost/gradient.
- Notebook: [Logistic_Regression_Microchips.ipynb](Logistic_Regression_Microchips.ipynb)

### 5. Multi-Class Neural Network: Handwritten Digit Classification
- TensorFlow dense net (400→25→15→10 logits), Adam, loss curve, accuracy.
- Notebook: [Multi_Class_Neural_Network.ipynb](Multi_Class_Neural_Network.ipynb)

### 6. Tree Ensembles: Heart Disease Prediction
