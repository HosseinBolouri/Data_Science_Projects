# Data Science, Machine Learning & Data Analysis Projects

Data Science portfolio showcasing SQL, Python (Pandas, SciPy, stats, numpy, matplotlib, TensorFlow), and Machine Learning (ML) projects from DataCamp, Coursera, and my Data Science role at STMicroelectronics.

## Projects
### 1. Univariate Linear Regression: City Profit Prediction (Supervised Learning)
- Implements linear regression from scratch (manual cost and gradient) to predict company profit based on city population (dataset: ex1data1.txt).
- Uses gradient descent (alpha=0.01, iterations=1500), plots learning data and fitted line, and predicts profit for populations of 35,000 and 70,000.

### 2. Investigating Netflix Data for 90s
- Exploratory data analysis of Netflix movies from the 1990s.
- Notebook: [Investigating_Netflix_Original.ipynb](Investigating_Netflix_Original.ipynb)

### 3. International Students Mental Health Analysis (SQL Project)
- PostgreSQL analysis on impact of stay duration on mental health.
- Notebook: [Project_SQL_Original_Students_Mental_Health.ipynb](Project_SQL_Original_Students_Mental_Health.ipynb)

### 4. NYC Public School SAT Performance Analysis
- Pandas analysis to identify top math schools, overall best schools, borough variability.
- Notebook: [NYC_Project_DataCamp.ipynb](NYC_Project_DataCamp.ipynb)

### 5. Two-Way ANOVA: Braking Performance Analysis
